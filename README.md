# Logistic-Regression-on-Epileptic-Seizure-Recognition-Dataset

Epileptic seizures are caused by a disturbance in the electrical activity of the brain. There are
many different types of epileptic seizures. Any of us could potentially have a single epileptic
seizure at some point in our lives.
here we build a model that classifies between those who have epileptic seizures and those who have not.
